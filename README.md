# What is this
In case you don't want to build your own security requirements for projects from scratch, but rather prefer to bootstrap [SecurityRAT](https://github.com/SecurityRAT/SecurityRAT) quickly with a default set of security requirements, you can use this MySQL dump and edit it afterwards based on your needs. 

# Usage
`mysql -u $your_db_user -p $your_db_name < requirements.sql`
